# Q-Learning Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Q-learning algorithm from scratch. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given problem. The algorithm learns to select actions by learning the quality of actions in a given state.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arker123/Q-learning.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd Q-learning
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the Q-learning algorithm by running the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script contains an example environment and a Q-learning agent that learns to navigate through the environment. You can modify the environment and the parameters of the Q-learning algorithm to test different scenarios.
